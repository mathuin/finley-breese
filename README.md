=============

An Android application that generates contact-specific ringtones in Morse code.


Quick start
-----------

1.  Add a custom field named 'FB' to a contact on your list.
2.  Run FB, and press the big button!

FB will now generate a custom ringtone for that contact.  The ringtone will be whatever was typed into the custom field converted to Morse code.


What other features are planned?
--------------------------------

* Additional ringtones, alarms, and notifications not associated with
  individual contacts.

* Change tone, character speed and word speed.

* Force update of some or all generated ringtones.
