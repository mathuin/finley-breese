=============

An Android application that generates contact-specific ringtones in Morse code.


Quick start
-----------

1.  Add a notes field to a contact on your list, set it to "ringtone: paris", and save the contact.
2.  Run FB, and press the big button!

FB will now generate a custom ringtone for that contact.  The ringtone will be the word "paris" translated into Morse code.


What other features are planned?
--------------------------------

* Additional ringtones, alarms, and notifications not associated with
  individual contacts.

* Change tone, character speed and word speed.

* Force update of some or all generated ringtones.
